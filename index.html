        <p>This website is going to have all the information one would need if they were interested in looking at my work. My work ranges from paintings, photography, sculpture, drawings, prints, mixed media, writing, most things you can think of. I'm still trying to find my artistic style and preferred media, so I'm all over the place. Maybe one day I'll have some stuff about music, as I'd like to learn to play an instrument. </p>
